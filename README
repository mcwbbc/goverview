== GOverview - Using GO to get an overview of publications and their annotation content

Goal is to find the number of unique PMIDs used for GO annotations along with the number of annotations (non IEA) made to those references

Get GO GAF files, load into gaf table, MD5 digest for identity key?

* Can rank all publications based on number of annotations from each pub

Get the Pubmed info for each pub - Authors, Journal, publication date

* can rank each publications on #annotations/#authors - bigger author list, more resources, expect more annotations...
* can rank journals - number of pubs generating GO annotations, average number of GO annotations per pub
** Could figure out how many articles were published by journal in a year/month and see what proportion are curated, how many annotations they provide
* can rank authors - number of annotations from their pubs (author mismatches will mess this up)

== BioRuby

Im using BioRuby to handle the PubMed access and record parsing

== TO DO

WITH field, 

Publication affiliation address/email (For lat/long and map view)
* Reload older pubs to get publication year and authors correct (In Progress)

* Reload earlier GAF to get extra fields

* Clone/fix BioRuby GAF parser to incorporate other columns and new GAF columns

* chart partial not using :object correctly
